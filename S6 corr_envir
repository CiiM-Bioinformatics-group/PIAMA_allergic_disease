## this script is to summary the results of the association of allery-associated CpGs with environmental factors
## EWAS of envrionmental factors were already done and were on the peregrine
## we mainly focus on environmental factors of secondary school, and looked into time window if we found significant CpG
## also did resampling of pets to confirm the direction is not random finding

## results of EWAS: peregrine folder: /data/p282473/PIAMA_envir/
## results of moulds: ./mould_pets/results/time_window_secondary_school/PIAMA_16_mould_brush_addSV_tw.gz
## results of pets: ./mould_pets/results/time_window_secondary_school/PIAMA_16_pet_brush_addSV_tw.gz
## results of active smoking: ./smoking/brush_noedu/PIAMA_16_Smoke16_brush_addSV_noedu.gz
## results of passive smoking: ./smoking/brush_noedu/PIAMA_16_PaS_brush_addSV_noedu_evernever.gz

## extract the results of 60 CpGs associated with allergy from listed results above.

## Check the significant CpG associated with pets in different time window
