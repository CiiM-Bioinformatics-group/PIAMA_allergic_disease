# PIAMA_allergic_disease
Rationale: Epigenetic signatures in the nasal epithelium, which is a primary
interface with the environment and an accessible proxy for the bronchial
epithelium, might provide insights into mechanisms of allergic disease. We aimed
to identify and interpret methylation signatures in nasal epithelial brushes
associated with rhinitis and asthma.
