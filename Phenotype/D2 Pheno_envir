##    1) Pets (1461 samples in total)
##             pet_GRP1PRB ~ pet_GRP5PRB probability used to generate trajectory
##             pet_GROUP: trajectory, 1 = very low; 2 = early life; 3 = mid-childhood; 4 = late childhood; 5 = persistently high
##             pet_infancy ~ pet_secondary: time window. for infancy 1= pets present at 3 months; 0 = pets not present at 3 months;
##                                          for secondary school: 1= pets present at 14 years; 0= pets not present at 14 years ;
##                                          for preschool and primary shcool there're 3 levels: 2 = had pets the entire time window; 1 = had pets at least 1 year (but not all of the years); 0 = no pets during any time within the time window
##   
##    2) Dampness and moulds (1461 samples in total)
##             mould_GRP1PRB ~ mould_GRP4PRB probability used to generate trajectory
##             pet_GROUP: trajectory, 1 = very low; 2 = persistently low; 3 = early life; 4 = childhood
##             pet_infancy ~ pet_secondary: time window. 0 = didn't exposed; 1 = exposed.
##
##    3) Second hand smoking (SHS) (1454 samples in total)
##             a. time window:
##                Smoke = smoke exposure during pregnancy: 3= Maternal active smoking; 2= Passive smoking >4hrs/day;1= Passive smoking<4 hrs/day;0= No active and no passive smoking (Never)
##                Smoke2 = Secondhand smoke exposure during infancy: 3= Always exposed; 2=yes<1X/week; 0=Non-exposed
##                Smoke3, Smoke4, Smoke5 = Secondhand smoke exposure during preschool, primary school and secondary school respectively: 3= Always exposed; 2=Sometimes exposed; 1=Rarely exposed; 0=Non-exposed.
##             b. logitudinal trajectories:
##                Group = Trajectory allocation: 1= Persistent very low; 2=Persistent low; 3=Early high; 4=Persistent high
##             c. others:
##                Response = Asthma at age 17.	1= Asthma, 0=No asthma
##                GRP1PRB,GRP2PRB, GRP3PRB, GRP4PRB=Group allocation posterior probabilities of groups 1,2 3 and 4 respectively
##                BGSCOOK = Gas cooking at 3 months.
##                BMAGE = Maternal age
##                Active = active smoking of child: 	1= active smokers, 0=no active smoking
##                Bgender = Gender: 1=Girls, 2=Boys
##                sib_birth= Older siblings at birth:	1=Yes, 2=No 	
##
##    4) Air pollution (915 samples, only have measurement in different time window)
##             no2, pm25abs, pm25, pm10, pmcoarse in preschool, primary school and secondary school.
